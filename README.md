# Graphics-Suite / GraphicsApp

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for GraphicsApp, a suite of graphical applications designed to demonstrate various form transformations and drawing algorithms.

## Features
- Circle and ellipse drawing algorithms
- Line drawing using Bresenham and DDA methods
- Form transformation utilities
- Basic debugging support for Windows

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Graphics-Suite/GraphicsApp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
